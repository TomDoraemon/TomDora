There was once a hero called Tom. Unfortunately one day, he slipped and fell on the snow and slid off a cliff. His name was thus forgotten by everyone.

But Tom did not forget the legacy he once had. He was mad at the people for forgetting who he was. He vowed to take revenge on those who had forgotten him.

He decided to enter the 2022 olympics to prove his superiority on the slopes and take revenge on the world. Being a hero -- a superhero, of course -- he had the ability to shoot ice from his hands and knew that nobody could be a match for him on any ski race. 

Tom, using the ice from his hands to propel him, soared into first place. But coming in hot from behind him was Tim, his younger brother and mortal enemy, who also had superpowers. Tim was shooting fire out of his hands to propel him at a blinding speed. The two were tied halfway through the race.
