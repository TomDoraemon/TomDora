There was once a hero called Tom. Unfortunately one day, he slipped and fell on the snow and slid off a cliff. His name was thus forgotten by everyone.

But Tom did not forget the legacy he once had. He was mad at the people for forgetting who he was. He vowed to take revenge on those who had forgotten him.
